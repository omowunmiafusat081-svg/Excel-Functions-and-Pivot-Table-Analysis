# Excel-Functions-and-Pivot-Table-Analysis
This project showcases my ability as a Data Analyst to clean, transform, and analyze raw data using **Microsoft Excel**.   The goal was to convert unstructured data into meaningful insights through Excel functions  and Pivot Table analysis , supporting data-driven decision-making.
## Project Objectives
- Clean and standardize raw data for accuracy
- Apply Excel functions for data transformation
- Analyze data using pivot tables
- Generate clear summaries and insights

##  Data Cleaning & Transformation
The following Excel techniques were applied:

- `TRIM()` – Removed unnecessary spaces to ensure consistency
- `PROPER()` – Standardized text formatting
- `SORT()` – Organized records logically
- `FILTER()` – Extracted relevant data for focused analysis
- **Additional Calculated Columns** – Created to improve analytical depth

##  Data Analysis (Pivot Tables)
Pivot tables were used to:
- Summarize key metrics
- Identify trends and patterns
- Compare performance across categories
- Support data-driven insights
---

## Excel Functions 
## Lookup Functions ; They are used to find and retrieve data from a specific row in a table or range.
- VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup): Searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.
- XLOOKUP (Modern Standard): A more flexible replacement for VLOOKUP. It can search in any direction (up, down, left, right) and defaults to an exact match.
## Logical Statements (IF, AND, OR)
These functions allow you to create "decision-making" logic within your spreadsheets. 

## **Common Functions,Best Used For...**
- Logical,"IF, AND, OR","Categorizing data (e.g., ""High"" vs ""Low"" revenue).
- Lookup,"VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP",Connecting different data tables together.
- Conditional Math,"SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS",Calculating total revenue by Region or Material Type.
- Statistical,"COUNTIFS, MAXIFS",Finding the number of repeat vs. one-time customers.
